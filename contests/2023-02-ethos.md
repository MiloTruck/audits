## [M-01] `_rebalance()` in `ActivePool` fails if a vault is at a deficit

### Vulnerability details

In the `ActivePool` contract, the `_rebalance()` function subtracts the amount of collateral currently in the vault (`vars.sharesToAssets`) from the amount originally allocated (`vars.currentAllocated`) to calculate its profit:

[ActivePool.sol#L248-L251](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/main/Ethos-Core/contracts/ActivePool.sol#L248-L251):
```solidity
vars.sharesToAssets = vars.yieldGenerator.convertToAssets(vars.ownedShares);

// if we have profit that's more than the threshold, record it for withdrawal and redistribution
vars.profit = vars.sharesToAssets.sub(vars.currentAllocated);
```

As seen from above, the `sub()` function from [`SafeMath`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/main/Ethos-Core/contracts/Dependencies/SafeMath.sol#L47-L49) is used to do the calculation. Hence, whenever the vault is at a loss, `_rebalance()` will always revert as `vars.currentAllocated` is less than `vars.sharesToAssets`, leading to an arithmetic underflow.

This affects the following functions as they call the `_rebalance()` function:

* `BorrowOperations.sol`
  * `openTrove`
  * `closeTrove`
  * `addColl`
  * `withdrawColl`
  * `withdrawLUSD`
  * `repayLUSD`
  * `adjustTrove`
* `TroveManager.sol`
  * `redeemCollateral`
  * `liquidate`
  * `batchLiquidateTroves`
  * `liquidateTroves`

### Impact

Whenever a vault containing one type of collateral is at a loss, all the functions listed above will revert when called with the same type of collateral, massively affecting the protocol's functionality. 

Moreover, since all the functions used to withdraw/transfer collateral are affected, all the borrowers who opened troves with the same type of collateral will have their collateral stuck in the protocol until the vault has a non-negative profit.

### Proof of Concept

The test in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/MiloTruck/5a6928720cfd8eb51a8c1214d5a1a250#file-rebalancedostest-js) demonstrates how a vault at a loss causes all the functions listed above to revert. 

To run the test:

* Copy [`MockBorrowerOperations.sol`](https://gist.github.com/MiloTruck/5a6928720cfd8eb51a8c1214d5a1a250#file-mockborroweroperations-sol) into `Ethos-Core/contracts/TestContracts`.
* Copy [`RebalanceDOSTest.js`](https://gist.github.com/MiloTruck/5a6928720cfd8eb51a8c1214d5a1a250#file-rebalancedostest-js) into `Ethos-Core/test`.
* Run the following command: `npx hardhat test ./test/RebalanceDOSTest.js`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider declaring `vars.profit` as a `int256`, and changing [ActivePool.sol#L250-L254](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/main/Ethos-Core/contracts/ActivePool.sol#L250-L254) to the following:
```js
// if we have profit that's more than the threshold, record it for withdrawal and redistribution
if (vars.sharesToAssets < vars.currentAllocated && vars.currentAllocated - vars.sharesToAssets >= yieldClaimThreshold[_collateral]) {
    vars.profit = -int256(vars.currentAllocated - vars.sharesToAssets);
} else if (vars.sharesToAssets > vars.currentAllocated && vars.sharesToAssets - vars.currentAllocated >= yieldClaimThreshold[_collateral]) {
    vars.profit = int256(vars.sharesToAssets - vars.currentAllocated);
}
```
