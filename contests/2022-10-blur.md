## [H-01] Misleading matching policy for ERC1155 tokens

### Impact
Due to the way `StandardPolicyERC1155` is coded, users will only receive 1 `ERC1155` token instead of the `amount` specified in their buy order.

### Vulnerability Details
In the `StandardPolicyERC1155`, contract, the functions `canMatchMakerAsk()` and `canMatchMakerBid()` return `1` as the amount to be transferred:
```solidity
// Using canMatchMakerAsk() as an example
24:    return (
25:        (makerAsk.side != takerBid.side) &&
26:        (makerAsk.paymentToken == takerBid.paymentToken) &&
27:        (makerAsk.collection == takerBid.collection) &&
28:        (makerAsk.tokenId == takerBid.tokenId) &&
29:        (makerAsk.matchingPolicy == takerBid.matchingPolicy) &&
30:        (makerAsk.price == takerBid.price),
31:        makerAsk.price,
32:        makerAsk.tokenId,
33:        1, // @audit This is the amount to be transferred in an order
34:        AssetType.ERC1155
35:    );
```
Thus, if `StandardPolicyERC1155` is used as the matching policy for an `ERC1155` order pair, only 1 `ERC1155` token will be transferred to the buyer, regardless of the `amount` specified in the order. Attackers could abuse this by creating sell orders with a high `amount`, misleading buyers into thinking they are buying more than 1 `ERC1155` token.

Furthermore, this goes against what is written in the `README`, which states `amount` works for `ERC1155` tokens:
> The responsibility of each policy is to assert the criteria for a valid match are met and return the parameters for proper execution -
> * `price` - matching price
> * `tokenId` - NFT token id to transfer
> * `amount` - (for erc1155) amount of the token to transfer
> * `assetType` - ERC721 or ERC1155

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
In `StandardPolicyERC1155`, check that `amount` is the same for both ask and bid orders, and return that instead.
