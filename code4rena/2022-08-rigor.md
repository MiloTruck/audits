# [M-01] Missing upper limit definition in `replaceLenderFee()` of `HomeFi.sol`

## Impact
The admin of the `HomeFi` contract can set `lenderFee` to greater than 100%, forcing calls to `lendToProject()` to all projects created in the future to revert.

## Vulnerability Details
Using the function `replaceLenderFee()`, admins of the `HomeFi` contract can set `lenderFee` to any arbitrary `uint256` value:
```solidity
185:        function replaceLenderFee(uint256 _newLenderFee)
186:            external
187:            override
188:            onlyAdmin
189:        {
190:            // Revert if no change in lender fee
191:            require(lenderFee != _newLenderFee, "HomeFi::!Change");
192:   
193:            // Reset variables
194:            lenderFee = _newLenderFee;
195:   
196:            emit LenderFeeReplaced(_newLenderFee);
197:        }
```

New projects that are created will then get its `lenderFee` from the `HomeFi` contract. When communities wish to lend to these projects, it calls `lendToProject()`, which has the following calculation:
```solidity
392:        // Calculate lenderFee
393:        uint256 _lenderFee = (_lendingAmount * _projectInstance.lenderFee()) /
394:            (_projectInstance.lenderFee() + 1000);
```
If `lenderFee` a large value, such as `type(uint256).max`, the calculation shown above to overflow. This prevents any community from lending to any new projects.


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider adding a reasonable fee rate bounds checks in the `replaceLenderFee()` function. This would prevent potential griefing and increase the trust of users in the contract.
